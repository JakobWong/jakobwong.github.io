Hi, Jinbin here. I am a second-year PhD student in computer science at [CIDSE](https://cidse.engineering.asu.edu/), Arizona State University, where I work with [Dr. Chris Bryan](chrisbryan.github.io) on data visualization. My current research focuses on how to leverage immersive technologies such as virtual reality to enable intuitive but insightful visualization. Besides that I am looking into explainable AI and data storytelling, two excitingly blooming areas in data vis that I want to contribute to.
